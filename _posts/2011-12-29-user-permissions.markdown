What is the difference between an agent and an admin?
-----------------------------------------------------

An admin has a few privileges that an agent does not have. Those include:

1. Ability to alter Company settings
2. Ability to add users
3. Ability to change the role of a user
4. Ability to create and edit labels
5. Ability to create groups
6. Ability to add users to groups

How do I change the role of a user?
-----------------------------------

The permission to change the role of a user is restricted to the admins. If you are an admin, you can change the role of a user by following the steps below.

1. Click on the Admin link in the top right corner of the main page after logging in.
2. Choose the ‘Users’ tab
3. Click on ‘Edit’ for the user whose role you want to change
4. Choose the appropriate role
5. Click on ‘Update User’
